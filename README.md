# covid_resources

A simple app that gives you all required covid related resources in one place, contributed and maintained by public, for public.

It contains details segregated by cities and basically four categories:

- Vaccine: Remdivisir and related stuff
- Oxygen: Info about oxygen cylinders
- Hospital: Info about hospital beds
- Plasma: Plasma related resources

## Contribution

Contribution is required to keep this thing running and data to be updated, whether you are a developer, designer or just someone who wants to update data on spreadsheet and keep the app updated, it would be very helpful.

For `developers`: before making a new issue, consider solving previous issues and if you are solving a new one, first make that issue.
Please check the `dev` branch for more info.
